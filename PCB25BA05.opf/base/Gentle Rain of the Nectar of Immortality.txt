Gentle Rain of the Nectar of Immortality
A Prayer for the Long Life of Sogyal Rinpoche
by Kyabjé Sakya Trichen

talé trötsen nyershyi chökü long
In the expanse of dharmakāya, beyond extremes, where all conceptual elaboration is pacified,
gakmé dechen longkü kyilkhor lé
From the unceasing great bliss of the saṃbhogakāya mandala,
yong shar tulku tsokyé gyalwa yi
Arises the nirmāṇakāya, the ‘Lake-born buddha’, Padmasambhava—
chok dü küntu gewé gatön tsol
Grant us, we pray, a joyful feast of virtue, universal and everlasting!

gyal kün yeshe dorjé nyingpö kham
From the indestructible moon of buddha nature—the wisdom of all the Victorious Ones,
sönam jewé sil zer yongdzokpé
You shine your cooling light—the rays of billion-fold acts of merit,
gyalten künda kyongwé nyen chikpu
And like the moon that nurtures the night-flowering jasmine, you alone preserve and uphold the
Buddha’s teachings—
nyikdü tsenmö gönpo shyabten sol
Protector in this dark night of the degenerate age, may your life be long!

ngön sak tsok nyi nordzin khyön yangpor
In the vast, spacious earth of the two accumulations you gathered in the past,
lab chen tukkyé tsawa rabten ching
The roots of your great and noble aspirations are firmly planted,
drub nyi drebü yaldab yong düpa
And you are replete with the abundant fruit of supreme and ordinary siddhis—
rigdzin paksam jönwang shyabten sol
Vidyādhara, you who are like a wish-fulfilling tree, may your life be long!

dzamling shar nub yuldru duma ru
All over this world, in many lands, east and west,
kalden sönam chen gyi mö lo shyin
According to the aspirations of those fortunate ones with stores of merit,
gang dul chö kyi dütsi tön dzepa
You reveal the nectar of Dharma, teaching in timely and appropriate ways—
tenpé gyaltsen dzin khé shyabten sol
You who are skilled at raising the victory banner of the Buddha’s teachings, may your life be
long!

lumé könchok sum gyi jinlab dang
Through the blessings of the Three Jewels, who are unfailing,
damchen chökyong sungmé tutsal dang
The strength of mighty oath-bound Dharma protectors and guardians,
chöying nampar dakpé den tob kyi
And the power of the utter purity of the dharmadhātu,
mönpé dön kün delak drub gyur chik
May the meaning of this aspiration of ours be instantly and effortlessly effected!

In accordance with requests made by the entire Rigpa saṅgha, this was written by the Sakya throneholder,
Ngawang Kunga. May its meaning be fulfilled!

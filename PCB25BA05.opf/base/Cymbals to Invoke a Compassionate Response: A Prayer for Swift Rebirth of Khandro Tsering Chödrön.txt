Cymbals to Invoke a Compassionate Response
A Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Khandro Tsering Chödrön
by His Holiness Sakya Trichen

gyal kün düshyal tsokyé dorjé sok
Lake Born Vajra Padmasambhava, the very face and embodiment of all the buddhas,
kyabné rabjam gyatsö tsok nam la
With the whole vast, infinite gathering of sources of refuge,
yomé dungwé yang kyi soldeb na
When I call on you, unwavering, in this heartfelt yearning melody,
mönpé dön di yishyin drubpar dzö
Let this prayer of mine come true!

nangtong yermé yeshe khandrö zuk
Appearance and emptiness indivisible, you appeared in the form of a wisdom ḍākinī,
gang tsering né khorlö gönpo dang
And have long been inseparable from the lord of the maṇḍala,
nyimé lhenkyé gar gyi rol dzepé
Delighting in the dance of the innate nature—
jetsün chö kyi drönmer solwa deb
Noble lady, “Lamp of Dharma”, to you I pray!

nyam dang tokpé ökar drawé chi
As the fresh, brilliant light fusing experience and realization
zab yang tuk kyi kha la tampa na
Arose in the profound and vast, sky-like expanse of your wisdom mind,
né sum khandrö gyukar trawé ü
You appeared amidst the bright constellations of the ḍākinīs of the three spheres,
ngönpar to shying shyuk la solwa deb
As the highest, most exalted of all—to you I pray!

gelek chushel kham chen lé trünpé
Arising from the great elements of virtue and goodness,
khyé ku nyagang dawé kyilkhor ché
You appeared like the great disc of the full moon,
nga dö mak gi gé nang dribwé dü
But now that the light of virtue is obscured by the darkness of the five degenerations,
lobur chulhar shyü di chi yi tsul
Suddenly, you have set to the West1—how could this be?

dechir daki tsenté ö shyak kyi
So, with all the radiance of the auspicious signs of a ḍākinī,
khyüpé yangsi nyishyön wangmo gang
May your rebirth swiftly appear, like the new rising sun
ten dro shar ri trakpar nyur jön né
That dawns over the eastern mountains of the teachings and beings,
gelek pemö dab tong drol gyur chik
And makes the thousand petalled lotus of virtue and goodness burst into bloom.

When the wisdom mind of the secret consort of Jamgön Khyentse Dorje Chang, Khandro Tsering Chödrön,
dissolved into the dharmadhātu, I, Sakya Trizin Ngawang Kunga of the Khön family composed
this with a clear mind of inspiration, just as the Rigpa saṅgha requested. May it
come to pass!
